land he owns is situated is an absentee owner.<br>
ABSTRACT &#8211; (noun) A summary or abridgment. A shortened form of a work<br>
or record retaining the general sense and<br>

sense or continuity. See ABSTRACT OF TITLE.<br>
ABSTRACT OF TITLE &#8211; A condensed history of the title to land,<br>
consisting of a synopsis or summary of the material<br>
or operative position of all the conveyances, which in any manner<br>
affects said land or any estate or interest therein,<br>
together with a statement of all liens, charges, or liabilities to<br>
which the same may be subject.<br>
ABUT &#8211; To reach; to touch. In old law, the ends were said to abut, the<br>
sides to adjoin. The term &#8220;abutting&#8221; implies a<br>
closer proximity than the term &#8220;adjacent.&#8221;<br>
ABUTTING PROPERTY &#8211; The buttings or boundings of lands, showing to what<br>

ACCRETION &#8211; Derived from the Latin &#8220;accrescere&#8221; which means to grow or<br>
increase, it is the gradual and<br>
imperceptible addition of soil or other material by the natural<br>
processes of water-borne sedimentation or by the<br>
action of currents against shores and banks. Accretion is the washing<br>
up of sand, silt or soil so as to form firm<br>
ground, called alluvion. In common practice the terms alluvion and<br>
accretion have been used almost<br>
interchangeably. Usually, however, alluvion means the deposit itself<br>
while accretion usually denotes the act. See<br>
ALLUVION, RELICTION, EROSION, AVULSION, RIPARIAN RIGHTS.<br>
ACCRETION, ARTIFICIAL &#8211; Additions to a riparian owner&#8217;s soil by the<br>
imperceptible process of accretion which<br>
was induced by man&#8217;s activities.<br>
ACCURACY (USC&amp;amp;GS. S.P. 242) &#8211; Degree of conformity with a<br>
standard, or accepted value. Accuracy relates to the<br>

to the quality of the operation by which the<br>
result is obtained. See PRECISION.<br>
ACEQUIA &#8211; A ditch, channel or canal through which water, diverted from<br>

ACQUIESCENCE &#8211; Some act of concurrence by the adjoining owners bearing<br>
on the practical location of their<br>
common boundary where the definite or more accurate position of the<br>
line or lines has not or cannot be defined by<br>

interposing a formal objection to what might be<br>
an encroachment by another, all subject to judicial review as to the<br>
legal effect.<br>
ACQUIRED LANDS &#8211; Federal lands obtained by purchase, condemnation,<br>
exchange, or gift under laws other than<br>
public land laws. Legally defined as: &#8220;&#8230; land obtained by the United<br>

patent under this act.<br>
ACT OF MARCH 1, 1800 &#8211; This act established a precedent for the<br>
important principle that corners regularly set by a<br>
cadastral surveyor in the field are held to be the true corners,<br>
although later surveys may show they were placed<br>
incorrectly.<br>
ACT OF MARCH 3, 1877 &#8211; See DESERT LAND ENTRY. Also See CAREY ACTS,<br>

half mile, but in Louisiana the errors were placed<br>
equally in each half mile of the last mile. In Florida they were<br>
sometimes placed on the south and east side of a<br>
township. The general instructions in the Manual of Surveying<br>
Instructions, 1855, directed all survey districts to<br>
handle the matter in the same way, however, irregular procedures<br>
continued to be used in some areas for a short<br>
time. See LAND DISTRICT.<br>

present numerical arrangement of the 36<br>
sections was adopted.<br>
ACT OF MAY 20, 1785 &#8211; See ORDINANCE OF MAY 20, 1785.<br>

ANALYTICAL PHOTOTRIANGULATION &#8211; A mathematical determination of ground<br>
positions of paneled points<br>
observed in a strip or block of aerial photographs. The positions are<br>
determined by computations based on<br>
coordinate measurements of the image positions in each photograph. This<br>

APPROVED SURVEY &#8211; The terms &#8220;approved survey&#8221; and &#8220;official survey&#8221; are<br>
often incorrectly used as being<br>
synonymous with &#8220;accepted survey.&#8221; Strictly speaking an &#8220;approved<br>
survey&#8221; is a survey which has the field notes<br>
approved and the plat accepted by the BLM official who has been<br>
delegated the authority for such action. The<br>
proper term is now ACCEPTED SURVEY. (Prior to 1910 the field notes and<br>
plats were APPROVED by the<br>
Surveyor&#8217;s General, which action was equivalent to the present<br>
acceptance of the plat. After 1910 they were<br>
approved by the Surveyor General, or Supervisor of Surveys, and after<br>
examination accepted by the Commissioner<br>
of the General Land Office.) The field notes and plat become OFFICIAL<br>
records of the BLM when filed in the<br>
appropriate land office. The field notes and the plats of Mineral<br>
Surveys are both APPROVED at the State Office<br>
level. See ACCEPTED SURVEY, OFFICIAL SURVEY and MINERAL SURVEY.<br>
APPURTENANCE &#8211; Anything so annexed to the land or used with it that it<br>
will pass with the conveyance of the land.<br>

property right and passing in possession with it.<br>
ARBITRATION &#8211; The submission for determination of disputed matter to a<br>
private unofficial person selected by<br>
agreement or in a manner provided by law. Voluntary arbitration is;<br>
therefore, by mutual and free consent of the<br>
parties.<br>
ARBITRATOR &#8211; A private, disinterested person chosen by the parties to a<br>
disputed question for the purpose of<br>
hearing their contention and giving judgment between them. The parties<br>
to the dispute submit themselves to the<br>
arbitrator&#8217;s decision (award).<br>

annually on valid claims for which a patent has not been issued.<br>
ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS &#8211; Written instructions to a cadastral surveyor<br>
authorizing him to execute a specific<br>
part, or all, of a particular survey. Even if the survey has been<br>
authorized, a surveyor may not execute it or any part<br>
of it without instructions containing his specific assignment. See<br>

ASTRONOMIC AZIMUTH &#8211; At the point of observation, the angle measured<br>
from the vertical plane through the<br>
celestial pole to the vertical plane through the observed object.<br>
Astronomic azimuth is the terrestrial azimuth which<br>
results directly from observations on a celestial body: It is measured<br>
in the plane of the horizon and is usuallyreckoned from south (0 ),<br>
through west (90 ), north (180 ), and east (270 ) back to south (360 or<br>
0 ). It is affected by the local deflection of the vertical (station<br>
error) which, in the United States, produces differences between<br>
astronomic and geodetic azimuths of as much as 26&#8221; in the mountain<br>
regions of the Western States and 10&#8221; in the<br>
less rugged Eastern States. Astronomic azimuths are sometimes reckoned<br>
clockwise or counterclockwise through 180 .<br>
ATTEST &#8211; To affirm to be true or genuine. Specifically, to authenticate<br>

AUTHORITY, PUBLIC LANDS &#8211; Article IV Sec. 3, Clause 2 of the<br>
Constitution of the United States established the<br>
fundamental authority for public land and resource management upon the<br>
adoption of the Constitution in 1787. It<br>
states: &#8220;Congress shall have the power to dispose of and make all<br>
needful rules and regulations respecting territory<br>
and property belonging to the United States&#8230;&#8221; It has been held that<br>
this power of Congress is without limitation.<br>

AUXILIARY GUIDE MERIDIAN &#8211; Where guide meridians have been placed at<br>
intervals exceeding the distance of<br>
24 miles (under practice permissible prior to issuance of the 1881<br>
Manual of Surveying Instructions which specified<br>
24 mile tracts), and new governing lines are required, a new guide<br>
meridian is established, and a local name is<br>
assigned, such as &#8220;Twelfth Auxiliary Guide Meridian West,&#8221; or &#8220;Grass<br>
Valley Guide Meridian.&#8221; Auxiliary guide<br>
meridians are surveyed, in the same manner as guide meridians.<br>
AUXILIARY MEANDER CORNER &#8211; An auxiliary meander corner is established<br>
at a suitable point on the meander<br>
line of a lake lying entirely within a quarter section or on the<br>
meander line of an island falling entirely within a<br>
section and which is found to be too small to subdivide. A line is run<br>
connecting the monument to a regular corner<br>
on the section boundary. See SPECIAL MEANDER CORNER.<br>
AVULSION &#8211; A river&#8217;s sudden change in flow alignment out from its<br>
previous left and right banks to a new channel,<br>
leaving an identifiable upland area between the abandoned channel and<br>
the new channel. The new flow alignment<br>
will generally be a shortcut in channel length because of hydraulic<br>
considerations. The U.S. Supreme Court in Iowa<br>
v. Nebraska 143 US 359 distinguished avulsion from rapid erosion, but<br>
some State courts have established different<br>
definitions. See Goins v. Merryman 183 Okla. 155. Frequently the<br>
elements of sudden and perceptible changes are<br>
included in the definitions. See ACCRETION, AVULSION*.<br>
AVULSION, ARTIFICIAL &#8211; Man-made or man-induced changes in flow<br>
alignment of a river such as to leave an<br>
identifiable area of upland between the old and new channels.<br>

Department of Agriculture was authorized to purchase submarginal farm
lands in the Great Plains region for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
purposes of reclamation, conservation, etc. Approximately 2 million

extent of the boundaries. See RULE OF TIDEMARK, STRAIGHT BASELINE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BASE LINE&nbsp; &#8211; A line which is extended east and west on a
parallel of latitude from an initial point, and from which are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
initiated other lines for the Cadastral Survey of the public lands

BASE PLAT&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A drawing containing only those details
essential to the identification of the legal subdivisions shown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
on it. Under the manuals of surveying instruction preceding that of
1930, the base plat also contained all cultural and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
topographic features thought to be desirable. The&nbsp; 1930 and
1947 Manuals of Surveying Instructions&nbsp; called for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
use of transparent color overlays to show these features when required.
Overprints are not needed where such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
features may be readily shown on the base drawing without risk of
obscuring any essential cadastral data. Color<br>

BATTURE&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A marine term, used to denote a bottom of
sand, stone or rock mixed together and rising towards the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
surface of the water; but it is sometimes used to signify the island
formed when it has risen above the surface of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ordinary high water. Batture differs from alluvium in that batture is
the addition of soil to the bed of a stream or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
lake, while alluvium is an addition to the shores. Hence by reason of
such fact the ownership thereof is determinedlargely along a different
line. Both&nbsp; &#8220;batture&#8221;&nbsp; and alluvium are often
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;referred to as&nbsp; &#8220;accretions.&#8221;&nbsp; Technically<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
however, the term&nbsp; &#8220;accretion&#8221;&nbsp; refers to the legal
result occurring from the effect of the deposit of alluvium and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
batture.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BEACH (T.R. No. 4)&nbsp; &#8211; The zone of unconsolidated material that
extends landward from the low water line to the place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
where there is marked change in material or physiographic form or to
the line of permanent vegetation (usually the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
effective limit of storm waves). The seaward limit of the beach &#8211;
unless otherwise specified &#8211; is the mean low water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
line. A beach includes foreshore and backshore. (Refer to Figure 1).

TIDELANDS.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BEARING&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The horizontal angle which a line makes
with the meridian of reference adjacent to the quadrant in which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the line lies. Bearings are classified according to the meridian of
reference, as: astronomic, geodetic, magnetic, grid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
assumed, etc. When no reference is specified on a plat or in a
document, astronomic meridian is presumed. A<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bearing is identified by naming the end of the meridian from which it
is reckoned, either north or south, and the direction of that
reckoning, either east or west. Thus, a line in the
northeast &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; quadrant making an angle of 50&nbsp;
from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the reference meridian will have a bearing of N. 50&nbsp; E.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BEARING OBJECT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A corner accessory which
may be a natural object that can be readily identified by its distance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and direction from the corner being recorded. These objects may not be
of a character that can be marked, but in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
case of a rock cliff or boulder a cross mark and the letters&nbsp;
&#8220;BO&#8221;&nbsp; will be chiseled into the bearing object. The record<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
should be clear enough to enable another surveyor to determine just
where the marks will be found. The rock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bearing object is the most permanent of all accessories; it is used
wherever practicable, and within a distance of 5<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
chains. a connection to any permanent artificial object or improvement
may be included in this general class of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
corner accessories. The field notes should be explicit in describing
such objects, and indicate the exact point to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
which a connection is made, as&nbsp; &#8220;pipe of Smith&#8217;s
windmill.&#8221;&nbsp; No marks are made on private property. See BEARING<br>

corner accessory; its distance and direction from the corner being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
recorded. Bearing trees are identified by prescribed marks cut into
their trunks; the species and sizes of the trees are<br>

BLACK HILLS MERIDIAN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The
principal meridian governing surveys in the western part of South
Dakota, it was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
established in 1878.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BLANK LINE&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; 1) Where bearings and distances are
shown, for information purposes only, across areas not then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
subject to survey. 2) In&nbsp; Manual of Surveying Instructions
1834,&nbsp; &#8220;thence north on&nbsp; a blank line; &#8230;&#8221; appears
used as a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
random line in specimen field notes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BLAZE&nbsp; &#8211; A mark made upon a tree trunk usually at about breast
height. The bark and a small amount of the live wood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
are removed with an axe or other cutting tool, leaving a flat, smoothed
surface which forever brands the tree. On<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
rough-barked tree monuments or bearing trees the appropriate marks are
scribed into a smooth, narrow, vertical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
blaze the lower end of which is about 6 inches above the root crown.
The blaze should be just long enough to allow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the markings to be made. See OVERGROWTH.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BLAZED LINE&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A sufficient number of trees
differing from line trees in that they stand within 50 links of and on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
either side of the line, rather than being intersected by it, are
blazed on two sides quartering toward the line. This is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
done to make the survey line more conspicuous and readily traced in
either direction. The blazes are made opposite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
each other coinciding in direction with the line where the trees stand
very near it. They are made closer to each<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
other, toward the line, the farther they are from the line. R.S. sec.
2395; 43 U.S.C. 751 is the law authorizing the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
marking of trees along surveyed lines, and its requirements are as
positive in this matter as are those requiring the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
erection of monuments. See LINE TREE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

BOARD OF LAND APPEALS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; Under the direction of a Board Chairman, the board exercises
jurisdiction over cases<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
involving appeals from decisions rendered by departmental officials
relating to the use and disposition of public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
lands and their resources and the use and disposition of mineral
resources in certain acquired lands and in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
submerged lands of the Outer Continental Shelf. Persons adversely
affected by a decision of a BLM officer or examiner have the right to
appeal to the board.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Board is in the Office of Hearings and
Appeals, the office of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Secretary of the Department of the Interior, as provided at 35 F.R.
10010, June 18, 1970 &#8211; 43 C.F.R. 1842.2 (Now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
43 C.F.R. part 4). Decisions of the Board on such appeals shall be
final for the Department.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BOG&nbsp; &#8211; A shallow, low-lying, virtually undrained body of
water, where partially decayed vegetation accumulates on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bottom and on the surface to form a mat. Mosses, sedges, grasslike
plants and small shrubs eventually take root in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the surface mat forming a&nbsp; &#8220;boggy&#8221;&nbsp; or spongy form of
ground. In an advanced stage the water area becomes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
completely filled and may become what is known as a&nbsp; &#8220;peat
bog.&#8221;&nbsp; See MARSH and SWAMP.<br>

BOISE MERIDIAN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The principal meridian

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BONA FIDE&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; In or with good faith; honestly, openly
and sincerely. Without deceit or fraud. Actual and genuine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BONA FIDE RIGHTS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Rights, such as in
ownership of land, which are real, actual, genuine and worthy of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
acceptance. Rights acquired in good faith under the law.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BOUNDARIES, NATIONAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; Boundaries between countries are established by treaties made by the
sovereign<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
powers concerned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BOUNDARIES, STATE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A boundary between
two States of the United States may be changed by agreement of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
State legislatures, but this agreement must be approved by Congress.
The United States Congress cannot change a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
State boundary without the consent of the State, nor can two States by
mutual agreement change their common<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
boundary without the consent of Congress. The consent of Congress to
change a boundary need not be granted by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
special act but may be inferred from subsequent legislation. Several
times Congress has given its consent in advance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
for adjoining States to fix an indefinite water boundary between them.
A boundary between a State and a territory is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fixed by joint action of Congress and the State. Boundaries between
territories are fixed by congressional action<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
alone. Disputes between States regarding boundaries must be settled by
the United States Supreme Court, whose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
decisions are final. It is a well-established principle, recognized by
the courts and by Congress, that a State or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
national boundary line as marked on the ground and accepted by the
parties interested is the legal boundary for all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
purposes whether or not it is the place designated by statute. Nearly
all boundaries of States west of the Mississippi,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as well as those of many central and southern States, were surveyed
under the direction of the General Land Office.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Notes of all such surveys, and plats for most of them, are now on file
in the Bureau of Land Management, Dept. of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Interior, or in the Cartographic Records Div., National Archives and
Records Service, Washington, D.C.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BOUNDARY, LAND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A line of
demarcation between adjoining parcels of land. The parcels of land may
be of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
same or of different ownership, but distinguished at some time in the
history of their descent by separate legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
descriptions. A land boundary may be marked on the ground by material
monuments placed primarily for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
purpose; by fences, roads, and other service structures along the line
&#8211; or defined by astronomically described points<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and lines.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BOUNDARY LINE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A line along which two
areas meet. A boundary line between privately owned parcels of land is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
usually termed a property line. If a boundary is a line of the United
States public land surveys, it is given a particular<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
designation, such as section line or township line.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BOUNDARY
MONUMENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; A material object placed on or near a boundary line to preserve and
identify the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
location of the boundary line on the ground.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BOUNTY LANDS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Portions of the public
domain given or donated as a bounty for services rendered, chiefly for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
military service. See 43 U.S.C.A., sec. 791.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BROKEN BOUNDARY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; 1)
A boundary of the rectangular system which is a series of line segments
representing a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
boundary which is not a straight line. 2) A boundary consisting of
straight line segments which is not part of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
rectangular system.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BROKEN BOUNDARY
ADJUSTMENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; A general term which indicates a distribution of a closing error.
Included<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
are: (1) A mathematical adjustment applied to record meander courses
which have since become nonriparian; is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
identical to the compass rule. (2) A mathematical adjustment applied to
the record courses of a grant or reservation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
boundary; it is a rotation and scale change that will retain the
original angles and change the lengths of each line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
segment proportionately according to the record. See GRANT BOUNDARY,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
CADASTRAL SURVEY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A
survey which creates, marks, defines, retraces or reestablishes the
boundaries and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
subdivisions of the public land of the United States.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
CADASTRAL SURVEY APPROVAL
AUTHORITY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; Prior to becoming an official cadastral survey the field notes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
must be approved and the plat, field notes and survey must be accepted
on behalf of the Director of the Bureau of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Land Management by the officer to whom he has delegated this
responsibility. See OFFICIAL CADASTRAL<br>

SURVEY.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
CADASTRAL SURVEY
AUTHORITY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; The authority derived from the statutory directive (43 U.S.C. 2)
that&nbsp; &#8220;The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Secretary of the Interior or such officer as he may designate shall
perform all executive duties appertaining to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
surveying &#8230; of the public lands.&#8221;&nbsp; Other statutory
declarations affecting the cadastral survey program are: 25 U.S.C.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
29 and 30; 43 U.S.C. 52-60, 751-775 and 1364.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
CALL&nbsp; &#8211; A reference to, or statement of, an object, course,
distance or other matter of description in a survey or grant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
requiring or calling for a corresponding object, or other matter of
description, on the land. See PASSING CALLS.<br>

CANAL GRANT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A grant made to a State to
aid in the construction of canals.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
CANCELLATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The annulment of
a former accepted survey. This action may be taken only by the Director
of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bureau of Land Management. It requires ample justification such as the
showing of gross irregularities. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
unreasonable distortion of section boundaries in both length and
direction and/or lines which are shown on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
record without ever having existed in fact may be deemed justification
for cancellation. This action applies to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
public land, and has no bearing on the identification of the alienated
subdivisions described in terms of the prior<br>

River case of Oklahoma vs. Texas in 1923 (260 US 606, 261 US 340, 265
US 493), which involved a non-navigable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
river, the Supreme Court of the United States declared by unprecedented
action that the Texas-Oklahoma boundary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
was to be determined by a medial line between gradient lines on each
bank. It was decided that&nbsp; &#8220;&#8230; channel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
extending from one cut-bank to the other, which carries the water in
times of a substantial flow&#8230; was the only real<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
channel and therefore the main channel.&nbsp; So its medial line
must be what was designated as the
boundary.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

COLOR OF TITLE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; If a claim to a piece of
real property is based upon some written instrument, although a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
defective one, the person is said to have&nbsp; &#8220;color of
title.&#8221;&nbsp; A claim which has as its basis that which the law
considers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
prima facie a good title, but which, by reason of some defect not
appearing on its face, is not in fact a title. Federal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
withdrawn land is not subject to the Color-of-Title Act. See

COLOR-OF-TITLE ACT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The Act of
December 22, 1928 (43 U.S.C., sec. 1068), as amended. Under the terms of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and provisions of this act, a patent may be issued for a parcel of not
more than 160 acres of public lands. The land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
must have been possessed in good faith by a claimant, his ancestors or
grantors for a period of more than 20 years.<br>

COLOR-OF-TITLE ENTRY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A cash
entry made by an entryman relying upon erroneous evidence of title. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Color-of-Title Act provides for this type of entry. However, land
attaching to Federal withdrawn land by accretion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
becomes withdrawn and is not public land subject to color-of-title
applications even when later separated from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
withdrawn land by avulsions. See COLOR OF TITLE, ACCRETION, AVULSION,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
compared to hand drafted copies thereof or compared to plats of
adjacent surveys. 5) Any factor in the land status<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

CONFLUENCE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Literally, flowing
together. The joining of two or more streams of water. Considering two
major<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
streams, the precise point of confluence is where the flow direction of
water along the thread of the smaller stream<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
reasonably parallels and joins the flow in the larger stream. In field
notes the point where the thread of a smaller<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
non-meandered stream crosses the meander line of the larger stream is

on a section by section basis, but with peripheral overlap between
diagrams. In this way the continuous relationship<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
between irregular land line conditions, particularly mining claims, is
shown. These diagrams are not official<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

DIVISION LINE BETWEEN A BOG AND AN UPLAND
AREA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; The line where the area occupied by a shallow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
virtually undrained bog area meets mineral soil, which lies above
ordinary high water. If upland vegetation is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
present, the inference will be that it has been an upland site for the
period equal to the age of the vegetation. See<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
occur which may normally be found only within the swamp zone. For
example, while certain varieties of trees are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
found only in upland situation, other varieties and other types of
vegetation may be found only within the zone of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the swamp. All such vegetation normally ends at the margin of permanent
water. See SWAMP.<br>

DIVISION LINE BETWEEN A SWAMP AND AN UPLAND
AREA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; The line where an area lying above the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ordinary high water elevation meets an area of low, wet land of such
character that without the construction of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
artificial reclamation methods it would be wet and unfit for
agriculture. See SWAMP, MARSH, BOG, SALT<br>

DOUBLE CENTERING*.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
DOUBLE CORNER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Normally the
two sets of corners along a standard parallel; the standard township,
section, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
quarter-section corners placed at regular intervals of measurement;
additionally, the closing corners established on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the line at the points of intersection of the guide meridians, range
and section lines of the surveys brought in from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the south. In other cases, not fully in conformity with the rectangular
plan, two corners, each common to two<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
townships only, instead of one corner of the four townships. Similarly,
two corners, each common to two sections;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and two quarter-section corners, each referring to one section only.
The term is sometimes used incorrectly to denote<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
two lines established on the ground although the field-note record
indicates only one line, thus creating a hiatus or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
overlap.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
DOUBLE MERIDIAN
DISTANCE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
1) The sum of the distances from the end points of a line to an
arbitrary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
reference north-south line used for area computations. Sometimes
considered as twice the distance from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
midpoint of a line, which is mathematically equivalent. 2) The method
of computing areas using DMDs or DPDs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
DOUBLE PARALLEL
DISTANCE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
The sum of the distances from the end points of a line to an arbitrary
east-west<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
line used for checking area computations by the DMD method.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
DOUBLE PROPORTIONATE MEASUREMENT (Also called &#8220;4-Way&#8221;
proportion)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; A method of restoring a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
lost corner of four townships or four interior sections. It gives
concordant relation between all parts of the times. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
new values given to the several parts, as determined by remeasurement
shall bear the same relation to the record<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
lengths as the new measurement of the whole line bears to that record.
In cases of distorted lines subject to double<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
proportion, measurements are comparable only when reduced to their
equivalent latitudes and departures. See<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SINGLE PROPORTIONATE MEASUREMENT and PROPORTIONATE MEASUREMENT.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
DOWER&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The portion of, or interest in, the real
estate of a deceased husband which the law gives to his widow for<br>

DRAINAGE ENTRY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; An entry, not
exceeding 160 acres, on public lands. Under Federal statutory
authority, a non-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Federal tax, or drainage charge, is levied against such lands to defray
the costs of draining swamp and overflowed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
lands. Also Drainage Homestead Entry.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
DRIFT&nbsp; &#8211; In mining, an underground passage driven horizontally
along the course of a mineralized vein or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

EQUITY&nbsp; &#8211; A system of law originating in the English chancery
and comprising a settled and formal body of legal and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
procedural rules and doctrines that supplement, aid or override common
and statute law. Rules of equity are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
designed to protect rights and enforce duties as created and defined by
law. In another legal meaning,&nbsp; &#8220;equity&#8221;&nbsp; is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
remaining interest belonging to one who has pledged or mortgaged his

remain after the property has been sold to satisfy liens. The amount of
value of a property above the total liens or<br>

imperceptible action, the rate of erosion may be quite rapid in total
effect and may be distinguished from avulsion by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the absence of identifiable upland between former and new channels. See

occupied are clearly in disagreement with the demonstrated position of
the legal subdivision called for in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In mining, the right to mine ore downward along a lode or vein beyond
the side lines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of a mining location (claim). The right is limited to claims which
contain the apex of the vein at or very near the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
surface, which are oriented with the lode line substantially along the
vein and which have the end lines substantially<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
parallel. The right does not extend beyond planes passing vertically
through the end lines. Extralateral rights of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
claims filed before May 10, 1872, were determined according to the
previous law of 1866 and by miner&#8217;s local rules<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

his heirs and legal representatives upon his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
death intestate. Fee simple title to public lands in conveyed by a
patent, approved clear list, deed or grant without<br>

adjacent quarter sections. 2) A median line of a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
nonnavigable stream becomes a fixed boundary after an avulsive change.
3) Meander lines can become fixed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&#8211; Retracement of survey lines using field<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and survey record evidence to determine the direction and distances
measured by the surveyor who created the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
boundary. The process usually requires remeasurement of topographic
calls, search for evidence of the previous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
survey work, determination of consistent of inconsistent chaining or
bearing error in the original survey, and<br>

MERIDIAN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
The part of this principal meridian which was adopted in 1815 governs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
surveys in part of Illinois. It was extended and the portion which was
adopted in 1831 governs surveys in Wisconsin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
FRACTIONAL SECTION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A section,
which in its original form, contained one or more subdivisions of less
than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
forty (40) acres due to irregular exterior boundaries, or due to the
encroachment of a meandered body of water or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
other land which could not properly be surveyed or disposed of as an
aliquot part of that section.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
FRACTIONAL TOWNSHIP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
A township containing less than 36 normal sections, usually because of
invasion by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
segregated body of water, or by other land which cannot properly be
surveyed as part of that township or by closing<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the public-land surveys on State boundaries or other limiting lines.
Half ranges and half townships are fractional<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

land islands and other lands of substantial<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
value and extent that for various reasons were not included in the
original surveys. Surveys of this type frequently<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
require consideration of the question of title prior to the extension
of the former surveys.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
FREE AND CLEAR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The title to property is
said to be&nbsp; &#8220;free and clear&#8221;&nbsp; when it is not
encumbered by any lien; but it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is said that agreement to convey land&nbsp; &#8220;free and
clear&#8221;&nbsp; is satisfied by a conveyance passing a title.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
FRONTING&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Usually signifies abutting, adjoining,
or bordering on, depending on the context. Land abutting on a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
highway, river, seashore or the like. The land extending along a road,
street, river, canal or ocean. The term, as used<br>

GENERAL LAND OFFICE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
The agency which was
formerly responsible for the execution of the public-land laws<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
relating to cadastral surveys, land disposals, and to various other
activities with respect to the administration and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
management of the public lands. It was established as a unit of the
Treasury Department in 1812, and so remained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
until 1949, when it became a part of the newly created Department of
the
Interior. It was abolished in 1946 when its<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
functions were combined with those of the Grazing Service to become the
Bureau of Land Management.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
GEODETIC AZIMUTH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
The horizontal angle at
station A measured from a north south plane (perpendicular to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
reference ellipsoid) clockwise to an ellipsoidal normal section passing
through station B. Geodetic azimuth is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
determined by applying a correction to astronomic azimuth or by
computations on the reference ellipsoid. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
azimuth from A toward B is the forward azimuth while the azimuth from B
toward A is the back azimuth of station<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
B. See&nbsp; GEODETIC*.<br>

(GLO)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The first
Geological Surveys of the public lands were initiated in 1844 by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
General Land Office, in Michigan. Similar surveys were made in
Wisconsin
and Iowa during 1847; in Oregon and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Washington during 1853; in Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming during 1857.
All
such surveys were performed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
under private contracts. The Geological Survey was not established as a
bureau of the Department of the Interior<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
until 1879.<br>

&#8211; Usually the
south and east boundaries of a township, but may be termed the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
satisfactorily surveyed lines on which subdivisions are to be based. In
rare and extreme cases, therefore, an irregular<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
township may be without a single governing boundary.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
GOVERNING SECTION
LINE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A township
subdivision line ran as the controlling boundary to rectify a defective<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
township exterior. The line is surveyed on a bearing calculated to
intersect the controlling corner on the opposite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
boundary. The last mile is run random and true. Completion of the

GRADIENT BOUNDARY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A
boundary determined by
the position of flowing water along a bank. First announced<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in Oklahoma vs. Texas by the U.S. Supreme Court (265 US 493), as
follows:&nbsp; &#8220;The boundary line is a gradient of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
flowing water in the river. It is located midway between the lower
level of
the flowing water that just reaches the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cut-bank and the higher level of it that just does not overtop the
cut-bank.. The physical top of the cut-bank, being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
very uneven in profile, cannot be a datum for locating the boundary
line
but a gradient along the bank must be used<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
for that purpose. The highest point on the gradient must not be higher
than
the lowest acceptable point on the bank<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Prime Meridian. The
meridian which passes through the original site of the Royal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Observatory at Greenwich, England was adopted in 1884 by a conference
of
nations as the initial or zero of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
longitudes. From it other longitudes are reckoned east and west. See
WASHINGTON MERIDIAN.<br>

GRID AZIMUTH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The angle in the plane of
projection
between a straight line and the central meridian (y-axis) of a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
plane-rectangular coordinate system. Although essentially a map
quantity, a
grid azimuth may, by mathematical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
processes, be transformed into a geodetic azimuth.<br>

GRID BEARING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The smaller angle in the
plane of
projection between a line and a north-south grid line. Grid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bearings are determined only by mathematical computations or by
applying
corrections to geodetic azimuths. See<br>

points as obtained
by inverse computation from the plane-rectangular<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
coordinates of the points. In the state coordinate systems, a grid
length
differs from a geodetic length by the amount<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of a correction based on the scale factor for the given line.<br>

HACK&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A horizontal notch cut well into a tree at
about breast height. In a cadastral survey, two hacks are cut to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
distinguish them from other, accidental marks. A vertical section of
the finished hack marks resembles a double-V<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
extending across a tree from two to six inches, depending on the
diameter of the tree.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The&nbsp; &#8220;blaze&#8221;&nbsp; and&nbsp; &#8220;hack&#8221;&nbsp; marks
are equally permanent, but so different in character that one mark
should never be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
mistaken for the other.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hacks are sometimes called&nbsp; &#8220;notches&#8221;&nbsp; or, in older
surveys,&nbsp; &#8220;chaps.&#8221;&nbsp; See BLAZE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
HALF&nbsp; &#8211; A fractional part of a regular section subdivision
determined according to equally divided linear measurements<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
without consideration of the areas of the halves.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Half a regular section consists of any two quarter sections which have
a common boundary, divided by a line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
between opposite  corners.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In past years, patents for half of a Government lot have been
erroneously issued. The division line was determined<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
by equally divided linear measurements without regard to the actual
area of the halves.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In private land exchanges, it is generally presumed that a conveyance
for half of a parcel grants half the area unless<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
otherwise stated.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
HALF-MILE POSTS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; In early survey
practice, in parts of Alabama and Florida, so-called&nbsp;
&#8220;half-mile posts&#8221;&nbsp; were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
established. In some cases the&nbsp; &#8220;half-mile post&#8221;&nbsp; was
not at mid-point on the section line. In other cases the&nbsp;
&#8220;half-mile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
post&#8221;&nbsp; was in true position for the quarter-section corner. In
still other instances the&nbsp; &#8220;half-mile post&#8221;&nbsp; was not
on true<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
line nor at mid-point on the line. Each set of field notes
regarding&nbsp; &#8220;half-mile posts&#8221;&nbsp; require individual
consideration,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as the survey practices were not uniform even within the same surveying
district.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
HALF-RANGE NUMBERS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
In the instances where the distance between the regular position for
township<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
boundaries is so great that the application of normal rules would
result in sections elongated in excess of 120 chains,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
half-range (or half-township) numbers may be created. Also used for
identifying areas left unsurveyed by hiatus. See<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
boundaries is so great that the application of normal rules would
result in sections elongated in excess of 120 chains,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

considering both the record and the survey conditions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
HAWAII ANNEXATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The
Republic of Hawaii was formally annexed to the United States by the
voluntary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
action of its citizens and a joint resolution of Congress approved July
7, 1898. The transfer of sovereignty took place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
August 12, 1898. Since Hawaii had been an independent nation, it was
not a public-land state.<br>

forces or it may have superimposed on it the effects<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of prevailing meteorological conditions.<br>

survey marker call for zinc-coated pipe cut to 30-inch lengths. One end
of the pipe is split and the two halves are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
spread to form flanges. The dimension from the top of the pipe to the
top of the brass cap is from  to  inch. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
measurement from tip to tip of the flanges is specified at 4 inches.
The measurement from the foot of the flange to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the top of the marker is 28 inches, more or less. The inside diameter
of the pipe is 2 inches. The weight is<br>

LAMBERT CONFORMAL CONIC MAP
PROJECTION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; A map plotting system in which points on the ellipsoid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
are mathematically projected onto a cone with its axis identical with
the polar axis. The cone surface may be tangent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to the ellipsoid or it may cut below the surface (secant) creating two
parallels where the scale is exact. The secant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
form of this projection is the basis of State Plane Coordinate Systems
where the zone extends more east-west than<br>

As the public land surveys spread, new land districts were created. As
the disposition of the public lands progressed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the work in a land district lessened, the land districts were
abolished. A provision of the Act of July 31, 1876,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
abolished the land districts in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. This was
about the same time as the creation of new land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
districts in Utah, Washington and Wyoming (43 U.S.C.A., sec. 121,

the Records Improvement Program in 1955, the records required in

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the plats from continual wear and damage and to preserve the
information they contain, a system was developed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

LANDS OPEN TO MINERAL
LOCATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; Lands held by the United States for disposal under the land laws are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
open to mineral location. Land specifically withdrawn, such as national
parks, national monuments, military<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
reservations and Indian lands are not subject to location. Minerals
found within a national forest are subject to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
location provided the discovery is such that it would justify an
ordinary prudent person his expenditure of time and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
effort in developing a paying mine. Without the existence of commercial
value, mineral claims within a national<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
forest are not valid locations. Lands such as the beds of navigable
bodies of water and land between high and low-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
water mark are not subject to location under the Federal mining laws.

LANDS SUBJECT TO
SURVEY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; In
accordance with legal requirements, the public domain lands of the
United<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
States that have not yet been surveyed under the system of rectangular
surveys are subject to survey. It is a well<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
settled principle of law that the United States, through the Department
of the Interior, Bureau of Land management,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
has the authority and duty to extend the public land surveys as may be
necessary. Lands erroneously omitted from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
earlier surveys are, for example, subject to survey.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

these trees were called&nbsp; &#8220;station trees,&#8221;&nbsp; and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
are sometimes called&nbsp; &#8220;sight trees,&#8221;&nbsp; but since the

the staking of the claim, sinking a discovery shaft, discovery of a
valuable mineral, posting a notice of location and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
recording the claim. In a broad sense there are 4 types of location:
lode or vein, placer, tunnel and mill site. In a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
secondary meaning, a location is the mining claim covered by an act of
appropriate or location. Also See MINING<br>

LOCATION NOTICE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; In mining, a
public notice of location of a mining claim. The object of the notice
is to inform<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the public. It must be filed and posted on the ground according to the
laws of the state where located. Usually it sets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
forth the name of the locator, the date, the name of the claim, and a
tie to a corner of the public land surveys. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
essential requirement of a location notice, however, is that it must so
describe and identify the location that it can be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
found by anyone interested in doing so, and that the boundaries may be
readily traced on the ground. See<br>

MARGINAL DATA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A memorandum in
the margin of a cadastral survey plat. The memorandum is intended to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
correlate and consolidate information regarding the record of surveys
as shown on the plat. Under the General land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MARSH&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; An area of low-lying, wet ground subject to
frequent or regular flooding or ordinarily covered with water.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Marsh vegetation is composed chiefly of reeds, grasses and grasslike
plants. In Cadastral Survey usage the word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;marsh&#8221;&nbsp; has usually been used to refer to coastal&nbsp;
&#8220;salt marshes.&#8221;&nbsp; See BOG, SWAMP and SALT MARSH.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MASTER TITLE PLAT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A composite
of the survey plats of a township on which is shown the ownership and
land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
status. See SUPPLEMENTAL MASTER TITLE PLAT and USE PLAT.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEAN BEARING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; 1) The average (mean) of
the forward and the back bearing of a straight line. 2) The average of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the bearings of an irregular boundary whose courses are nearly equal in
length. 3) The weighted average of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
azimuths of an irregular boundary after conversion to an equivalent
bearing. 4) The average of the bearings of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
opposite subdivision lines. 5) The mean of a series of bearings
obtained by measurement. See BACK BEARING.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEANDER CORNER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A
corner established at the intersection of standard, township or section
lines with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
meander line near banks of navigable streams or any meanderable body of
water.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEANDER FIELD BOOK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
Page 24 of the Manual of Surveying Instructions, 1851,
states:&nbsp; &#8220;Both banks of navigable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
streams are to be meandered by taking the courses and distances of
their sinuosities and the&nbsp; same are to be entered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the meander field book.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEANDER LINE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; the traverse run at the
line of mean highwater of a permanent natural body of water. In original<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
surveys, meander lines are not run as boundary lines. They are run to
generally define the sinuosities of the bank or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
shore line and for determining the quantity of land in the fractional
sections remaining after segregation of the water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEAN HIGH WATER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; 1)
The elevation of the water at the margin of the area occupied by the
water for the greater<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
portion of each average year, as determined by vegetative, on
topographic changes. 2) As applied by NOS, the mean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of all high waters are a considerable period of time, usually 18.6 or
19 years.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEAN LOW WATER (USC &amp; GS. S.P.
242)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The mean height of all low waters
at a particular point or station over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a considerable period of time. For tidal waters, the cycle of change
covers a period of about 18.6 years, and the mean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
low water is the mean of all low waters for that period. For any body
of water, it is the mean of all low waters over a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
period of time of such length that increasing its length does not
appreciably change the mean.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEAN SEA LEVEL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The average height of
the surface of the sea for all stages of the tide over a 19-year period,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
usually determined from hourly height readings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEAN TIDE LEVEL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; (Also called half-tide
level) a plane midway between mean high water and mean low water.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because of the lack of symmetry of the tidal curve this is not the same
as mean sea level. See MEAN SEA LEVEL.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MECHANICAL
PHOTOTRIANGULATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; This method (also known as the analogue or instrumental method) of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
phototriangulation establishes positions and elevations by use of an
instrument viewing a spatial model. Precise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
connections are made between successive models which in turn are tied
to vertical and horizontal control. This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
method which, after adjustment, allows an accurately scaled
representation of the project area to be depicted, has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
been used for several successful cadastral survey projects. However,
due to the fact that the accuracy of the data<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
obtained by use of the analytical process is usually of a higher order
than that obtained by the mechanical methods,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Bureau of Land Management has adopted analytical phototriangulation
for use in photogrammetric cadastral<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
surveys. See ANALYTICAL PHOTOTRIANGULATION.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEDIAL&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Situated in or pertaining to the middle;
intermediate. See MEDIAL LINE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEDIAL LINE&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; In surveying, the term refers to a
particular line which must be determined by the consideration of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
various factors, or the weighing of evidence, as well as the use of
measurement and/or calculation. An example<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
would be the determination of the center of the main channel of a river
as distinguished from the measurement or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
calculation of a line midway between its banks. Occasionally used as
though synonymous with&nbsp; &#8220;median line.&#8221;&nbsp; See<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEDIAN LINE, CHANNEL and MAIN AND GRADIENT BOUNDARY.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEDIAN&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Noting or pertaining to a plane dividing
something into two equal parts, especially one dividing a thing into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
left and right halves. In geometry, a straight line from the vertex of
a triangle to midpoint on the opposite side. See<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEDIAN LINE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEDIAN LINE&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The&nbsp; &#8220;median line&#8221;&nbsp;
of a body of water is a line, every point of which is equidistant from
the nearest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
point on opposite banks or other reference lines. The median is a
continuous line formed by intersecting straight line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
or curve segments.&nbsp; &#8220;Median line&#8221;&nbsp; may also refer to
the average of the distances between non-parallel lines. See<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEDIAL LINE and MEDIUM FILUM ACQUAE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEDIATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The act of a third person who
comes between two opposing parties in order to persuade them to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
compromise, adjust or settle their dispute.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEDIATOR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A third person who tries to
get two opposing parties to reach a compromise or otherwise settle their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
dispute.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEDIUM FILUM
ACQUAE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
The geographic middle of a river supposed to divide it into two equal
parts, without<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
considering the channel or channels of the river. Identical with a
median line, every point of which is equidistant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
from the nearest points of the baseline on the opposite shores. See
THALWEG.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEMORIAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A durable article deposited in
the ground at the position of a corner to perpetuate that position
should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the monument be removed or destroyed. The memorial is usually deposited
at the base of the monument and may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
consist of anything durable, such as glass or stoneware, a marked
stone, charred stake or a quantity of charcoal.<br>

corner point established by a Cadastral Survey. Objects, to be ranked
as monuments, should have certain physical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
properties such as visibility, durability and stability, and they must
define location without resorting to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
measurements.&nbsp; &#8220;Monument&#8221;&nbsp; and&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as reference to an adjoining title, a plat, or physical evidence of a
boundary, such as a fence. Occasional reference<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

NAVIGABILITY, LEGAL CONCEPT
OF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The
doctrine laid down by the Supreme Court in The Daniel Ball, 10<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wall. 557 (1871), to wit:&nbsp; &#8220;Those rivers must be regarded as
public navigable rivers in law which are navigable in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fact. And they are navigable in fact when they are used, or are
susceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as highways for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be
conducted in the customary modes of trade or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
travel on water.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NAVIGABLE WATERS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
Waters which afford a channel for useful commerce or travel. The beds
of navigable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bodies of water are not public domain and are not subject to survey and
disposal by the United States. Under the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
laws of the United States the navigable waters have always been and
shall forever remain common highways. This<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
includes all tidewater streams and other important permanent bodies of
water whose natural and normal condition as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the date of the admission of a State into the Union was such as to
classify the same as navigable water.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NEAP TIDES&nbsp; &#8211; Tides of decreasing range occurring semimonthly
as the result of the moon being in quadrature; that is,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
when the tidal forces of sun and moon act at right angles to each other
on the waters of the earth. Tides during these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
periods do not rise as high or fall as low as during the rest of the
month. See TIDE.<br>

determining angles. It was named for a Portugese<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
mathematician and geographer, Nunez (1492-1577). Later, the nonius was
replaced by the vernier scale (named for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dutch mathematician Peter Werner who, in his writings, used the
name&nbsp; &#8220;Pierre Vernier&#8221; ). As late as 1879, in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Germany, a vernier was called a nonius.<br>

a correction to each record course<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
based proportionately upon the length of the course. 2) The method
generally used to mathematically close (balance)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a figure in order to determine area. 3) May be referred to as

of disposing of lands in the western territory.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
was adopted by the Continental Congress on May 20, 1785. Under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
its terms the rectangular system of surveys was inaugurated. Six-mile
square townships extended north from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ohio River and were numbered south to north. Ranges were numbered east
to west. Sections (called lots) were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
numbered from 1 to 36 from south to north in each range with number 1
in the southeast corner. Also included was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
occupied by the States of Idaho, Oregon and Washington and parts of
Montana and Wyoming was ceded to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
United States by Great Britain. This cession provided the United States
with more than 183 million additional acres<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Louisiana Purchase (1803), by the cession from Spain (1819), by the
occupation of the Oregon Territory (1846),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

North, south of the 49&nbsp; parallel and west of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

public domain. Authorities differ as to the method and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to the exact date of its acquisition by the United States, some holding
that it was part of the Louisiana Purchase. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
area included within the present boundaries of the State of Tennessee,
although included in the cessions of the 13<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Original States, is usually not considered a part of the original
public domain because, by the terms of its cession,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the State of North Carolina passed title to only a small acreage in
that area to the United States. The United States in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
turn ceded its unappropriated lands to the State of Tennessee. The
submerged lands granted to the states under<br>

session of the 83&nbsp; Congress and signed into law Aug. 7, 1953.
It provides for the jurisdiction, control and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
administration by the United States over the submerged lands seaward of
the state&#8217;s boundaries as defined in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Submerged Lands Act (Public Law 31); that is over the outer continental
shelf. Senate Report 411, regarding this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
act, made it clear that the outer edge of the shelf is the point where
the continental slope leading to the true ocean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bottom begins and that this point is generally regarded as the depth of
approximately 100 fathoms. At the 1958<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Geneva Conference, the Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf
adopted the 100-fathom depth curve as a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
minimum limit and beyond that if exploitation is feasible. See

thereby. Parentheses are used where the record is not supplied by the
field notes, indicating that the distance was not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
measured on the ground. The figures show what was used in the
calculation of areas. The same lengths are to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
adopted proportionately whenever there is a need for an establishment
of sixteenth-section corners on the section<br>

&#8211; The Act of October 22, 1919, under the terms of which an entry of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
public lands in Nevada could be made by an individual or association of
individuals who earned the right to acquire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
title to a portion of the public lands through discovery of underground
water sources.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

LOCATION, MINERAL SURVEY, LODE, and VEIN.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PLACER ACT OF 1870&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Under this act, placer claims
included&nbsp; &#8220;all forms of deposit, excepting veins of quartz, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
other rock in place.&#8221;&nbsp; It did not restrict placer claims to
valuable deposits, probably due to an oversight. There was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
no provision for the reservation of known lodes within placer patents.
Placer locations were limited to not more than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
160 acres for any person or association of persons, though patents for
additional acreages could be issued where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
adjoining claims had been purchased by the locator. See MINING ACT OF
1866, MINING LAW OF 1872 and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PLACER LAW OF 1897.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PLACER CLAIM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A mining claim located on
the public domain for the purpose of placer mining. Under U.S. mining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
laws, mineral deposits not veins or lodes in place, are treated as
placers so far as locating, holding, surveying, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
patenting are concerned. Revised Statutes, sec. 2331 (30 U.S.C., sec.
35) provides that all placer-mining claims<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
located after May 10, 1872, shall conform as nearly as practicable with
the United States system of public land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
surveys and the rectangular subdivision of such surveys, and such
locations shall not include more than 20 acres for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
each individual claimant (43 C.F.R. 3842.1-2(b)).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PLACER LAW OF 1897&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; This law provided
that petroleum lands might be entered and patented under the placer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
mining laws and led, eventually, to the leasing of public lands
valuable for minerals.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PLACER LOCATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A placer
claim located and occupied on the public domain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PLAINTIFF&nbsp; &#8211; A person who brings an action; the party who
complains or sues in a personal action and is so named on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the record. See DEFENDANT.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PLANE COORDINATES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
In general, coordinates specifying the location of points on a plane.
In surveying use, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;plane&#8221;&nbsp; is usually a projection of the earth&#8217;s surface such
as a developed cone or cylinder.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PLAT&nbsp; &#8211; As used technically by the BLM, the drawing which
represents the particular area included in a survey, such as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a township, private land claim or mineral claim, and the lines
surveyed, established, retraced or resurveyed, showing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the direction and length of each such line; the relation to the
adjoining official surveys; the boundaries, descriptions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and area of each parcel of land subdivided; and, as nearly as may be
practicable, a representation of the relief and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
improvements within the limits of the survey. See BASE PLAT,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
POCKET PARTS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Revisions prepared for
bound law books to keep them current. The name comes from the fact that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
these supplements, usually in pamphlet form, are stored in a pocket
inside the back cover of the volume undated.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
POINT&nbsp; &#8211; A position or location in a reference system
determined by survey, See POINT*.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
POINT OF BEGINNING, THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The
point on the west boundary of the State of Pennsylvania at the north
bank of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ohio River is the point of beginning for the survey of the public lands
of the United States. The point was marked by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a stake on August 20, 1785.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
POINT OF DISCOVERY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; In mining,
the precisely indicated position at which a valuable mineral is exposed
to view.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the absence of proof to the contrary, the discovery point is held to
be the center of the vein on the surface. See<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
DISCOVERY and VEIN DISCOVERY.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
POINT ON LINE&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A stake or other object a surveyor
has placed on a line for his convenience, such as for a back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
sight. In earlier times, under regulations found in various manuals of
surveying instructions, surveyors were to set a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Point on Line (POL) on top of ridges or spurs, at places where the line
crossed trails or roads and at other like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
places. This was done to facilitate identification of the line. This
type of point is now called a witness point. See<br>

POSSESSION IS NONE-TENTHS OF THE

&#8211; This adage is not to be taken as true to the full extent. It does,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
however, focus light on the legal truth that every claimant must
succeed by the strength of his own title and not by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the weakness of his antagonist&#8217;s. Prior to passage of statutory mining
laws in this country, miners made this, quite<br>

POWER-SITE RESERVE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A
reservation of public lands which have been classified as having
potential value for<br>

water power development and which have been so designated under the Act
of June 20, 1910 (39 stat. 557), June 9,<br>

uniformity and repeatability of observations. See PRECISION*.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PREEMPTION ENTRY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; An
entry of public lands for purchase under the preemption laws. These
laws, now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
repealed, gave the entryman a preferred right to acquire the land by
virtue of his occupation and improvement to it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PREEMPTION RIGHT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The right
given to settlers upon the public lands of the United States to
purchase such lands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PRESCRIPTION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The manner of acquiring
adverse rights in another&#8217;s land. Prescriptive rights are similar to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;adverse possession&#8221;&nbsp; but that term is used for title
interest.&nbsp; &#8220;Prescription&#8221;&nbsp; refers to rights of use in
land belonging<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to another, such as right of access, grazing rights or the right to
divert flood waters. See ADVERSE POSSESSION<br>

PRESCRIPTIVE RIGHT OF
WAY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A right of way
based upon its adverse using extending to the limits of tradition<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

consent, either expressed or implied, of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
owner of the land crossed. If a claim to a right of way is based upon
the fact that the owners of a certain ranch have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;always&#8221;&nbsp; driven across a portion of another ranch, that may
be the basis for a&nbsp; &#8220;prescriptive&#8221;&nbsp; right of way. See<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
patent before issuance by the General Land Office. Beginning in 1833,
the President&#8217;s name was written on every<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
land patent by an authorized secretary or executive clerk. The
necessity for the President&#8217;s signature on all land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

PROPORTIONATE
MEASUREMENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; A proportionate measurement is one that applies an even distribution
of a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
determined excess or deficiency of measurement, ascertained by
retracement of an established line, so as to give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
concordant relation between all parts; that is, the new values given to
each of the several parts, as determined by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
measurement, shall bear the same relation to the record lengths as the
new measurement of the whole line bears to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that record. It should be noted that the rule is not ordinarily
applicable in treating gross error or blunder, if the latter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
can be definitely segregated. See DOUBLE PROPORTIONATE MEASUREMENT and

responsibility of the surveyor to examine, weigh and interpret the
available evidence in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

the valid rights acquired under the original survey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as shown by the plat. The bona fide rights of claimants are protected

RAILROAD GRANT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Usually, title
to railroad grant lands passed under patent conveyances. These grants
were made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to railroads to aid in their construction, and covered designated
sections within specified grant limits. Prior to 1875,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
railroad right-of-way grants conveyed a hybrid type of interest in the
public lands. Laws authorized each grant and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
set forth the limits of the grant and the lands granted. In determining
these limits, and ascertaining the interests<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
obtained under the various grants, legal advice may be required. See

RAILROAD GRANT, ADJUSTED OR
UNADJUSTED&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; If the legal processing (adjudication) was terminated, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the grantee received all the lands to which entitled or as much as it
was possible to give under the terms of the grant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
prior to the Transportation Act of 1940, it is termed an&nbsp;
&#8220;adjusted&#8221;&nbsp; railroad grant. If the adjudication was not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
completed prior to that time, it is called an&nbsp;
&#8220;unadjusted&#8221;&nbsp; railroad grant. See RELEASED RAILROAD CLAIM.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RAILROAD INDEMNITY

RANDOM LINE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; a trial line run from one
monument toward the next monument so that the difference in latitude and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
departure between monuments may be determined and the true line may be
computed. On the trial line, temporary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
intermediate corners are set. Offsets may then be computed from the
temporary corners to the correct positions on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the true line. See TRUE LINE, RANDOM AND TRUE AND CORNER MOVE.<br>

RANDOM AND TRUE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A
survey method whereby a trail line is run to connect two monuments.
With the data<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
obtained while running the trial line, the true line is computed and
rerun.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

RED RIVER CASE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; When oil was discovered
in the Red River Valley between Oklahoma and Texas, land prices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
soared. The location of the Oklahoma-Texas boundary line, once a part
of the boundary between the United States<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the Spanish holdings in the Southwest, became a matter of great
importance. Any rights to the bed or the banks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the river were dependent upon the wording of the treaty of 1819. In
1919 Oklahoma entered in suit against Texas<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the United States intervened as a protection of the rights of Iowa
and Comanche Indians. The suits involved<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
amounts of more than $100 million. The U.S. Supreme Court proceedings
fill 5,510 printed pages in nine volumes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the case required more than five years to settle. As a result of
this landmark case, a new and unprecedented<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
principle of law for the establishment of river boundaries came into
being. (260 U.S. 606, 261 U.S. 340, 265 U.S.<br>

&#8220;returned.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RETURNS&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Official reports. In cadastral survey
parlance, the&nbsp; &#8220;returns&#8221;&nbsp; are the field notes, report

a whole. In 1873, all of the general and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
permanent laws of the United States then in force were arranged by
subject under 74 headings and enacted into law<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
by Congress. This compilation was corrected and superceded by another
codification of the laws in 1878. The 1878<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
codification is known as the&nbsp; Revised Statutes.&nbsp; The
sections of the Revised Statutes are numbered consecutively.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When cited, the section number should follow the abbreviation&nbsp;
R.S.&nbsp; Thus, R.S. 2478 is a citation to section 2478 of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Revised Statues. A citation to the Revised Statutes is always
understood to refer to the codification of 1878, See<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RIPARIAN BOUNDARIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Water
boundaries, or boundaries formed by a river, lake or the sea. The
general rule is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that riparian boundaries shift with changes due to accretion or erosion
but retain their original location if brought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
about by avulsion or by artificial causes. See ACCRETION, AVULSION,
RELICTION, EROSION, RIVER BED<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and LITTORAL.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RIPARIAN LANDS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; In strict
interpretation, lands bordering on a river. The term&nbsp;
&#8220;riparian&#8221;&nbsp; is also used as relating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to the shore of the sea or other tidal water, or of a lake or other
considerable body of water not having the character<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of a watercourse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RIPARIAN LAW&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The branch of the law
which deals with the rights in land bordering on a river, lake or sea.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RIPARIAN OWNER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; One who owns
land having a boundary defined by a water course. Usage has broadened
the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
term to include land along the sea or other tidal water, or along the
shore of a lake or other considerable body of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
water. Strictly speaking, the correct term for lands bordering the sea,
or other tidal water, is&nbsp; &#8220;littoral.&#8221;&nbsp; See<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
LITTORAL.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RIPARIAN RIGHTS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The rights of an owner
of land bordering on a river, lake, bayou, or sea which relate to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
water (its use), ownership of the shore, right of ingress and egress,
accretions, etc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RIPARIAN RIGHTS ENTRY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; An
owner of contiguous land may be permitted to make such an entry of
public lands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
when, due to erroneous meandering of a river, lake, or other body of
water, public lands are shown on the original<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
survey plat as water-covered areas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ROD&nbsp; &#8211; One rod equals 16.5 feet or 25 links. Also
termed&nbsp; &#8220;perch&#8221;&nbsp; or&nbsp; &#8220;pole&#8221;&nbsp; in
older surveys.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ROOD&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A square measure equal to  acre or 40 sq.
rods. The term rood was sometimes used also for a linear measure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
varying locally from 5 yd. To 8 yd..<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RULE OF APPROXIMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; A purely administrative expedient intended to equitably decide
whether an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
entryman could obtain patent to more than the area provided by the
Preemption and Homestead laws, still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
maintaining the contiguity of tract entered. Where the excess is less
than the deficiency would be if the smallest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
legal subdivision is excluded from the entry then it is allowed to
stand. (See 8 LD 205). Thus, if an entryman selects<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
surveyed lands in excess of the statutory amount, say 175 acres, the
Rule would allow him to pay for and receive the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
excess fifteen acres under certain conditions. The principle condition
is that the excess cannot exceed the deficiency<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
which would occur if the smallest legal subdivision were disallowed.
The Rule would not be applied if the entryman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
had made substantial improvements to the tract disallowed and the
differences were small (27 LD 78). The final<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
selection was required to be one continuous tract after application of
the Rule.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If, in the sample, the selection included aliquot parts containing 40,
40.50, 65 and 29.50 acre lots totaling 175 acres,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the 29.50 acre lot would be disallowed because 40 + 40.50 + 65 = 145.50
which is deficient by only 14.5 acres<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
whereas the excess was 15 acres. The Rule does not apply to the mining
laws except placer claims filed by legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
subdivisions of 10 acres, (34 ID 9). It does not apply to claims in
unsurveyed areas, (28 ID 149). See 43 CFR<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2731.6-1 concerning acreage limitations and the application of the rule
of approximation in the matter of small<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
tracts. See DE MINIMIS NON CURAT LEX.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RULE OF THALWEG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; In river
boundaries, the rule which holds that where a navigable river separates
two nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the middle of the main channel is the boundary between them, as
distinguished from the geographic middle of the<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
river, per Shalowitz. The rule of thalweg has also been applied to
other boundaries where the boundary is described<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as being the&nbsp; &#8220;middle (or center) of the main
channel&#8221;&nbsp; of a navigable river. See THALWEG, MEDIUM FILUM<br>

ACQUAE, GRADIENT BOUNDARY and MEDIAL LINE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RULE OF TIDEMARK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A baseline
for determination of coastal boundaries which follows the sinuosities
of the low<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
water mark except where true bays are encountered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

SCHOOL LAND PATENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
A patent which is issued to a State to give it additional evidence of
title to a school<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
section since title to school sections ordinarily passes to a State

lands. See GRANT IN PLACE and IN PRAESENTI.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SCHOOL LANDS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Sometimes referred to
as&nbsp; &#8220;school sections&#8221;&nbsp; they are the lands included in
a grant in place, or a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
grant in praesenti, to a State in support of common schools. Under the
Ordinance of May 20, 1785, section 16<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(called Lot 16 in the Ordinance) in each township was set aside for the
maintenance of public schools. In 1850 this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
was changed to sections 16 and 36. In Arizona, New Mexico and Utah,
sections 2, 16, 32 and 36 were granted.<br>

SEGREGATION SURVEY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
Definition by running survey lines on the ground which separate
appropriated lands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
from the public lands. See MINERAL SEGREGATION SURVEY.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SELECTION&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; In general, an application to acquire
title to public lands which is submitted by an applicant who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
acquired the right to apply for such lands by receipt of a grant, by
surrender of his own lands in an exchange, by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
relinquishment of his rights to other lands (lieu selection), by
surrender of scrip or by similar means.<br>

which was surveyed and approved first. See SENIOR RIGHTS.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SENIOR RIGHTS&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The rights which take precedence.
The first patent issued usually takes precedence in a situation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
where a later survey is in conflict with an earlier survey. The first
patent issued usually has the superior (senior)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
right or title regardless of the dates of the surveys.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SERIAL REGISTERS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Serial registers were
instituted in 1908 as a digest of land case records. BLM maintains these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
individual chronological records of each public land transaction. Each
transaction (case) appears as a page or pages<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in a serial register. Each one is identified by the serial number
assigned to it. A running record of each case, its<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
inception and any actions on it, is kept in book form in the land
office of each public domain land state. Serial<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
register pages are now microfilmed for ease in retrieval of information
as well as to conserve space. As cases are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
closed the files for them are sent to Federal records centers of the
General Services Administration. Also See<br>

SEVEN RANGES, THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The first cadastral
survey of the public lands of the United States began in July 1786, in
the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
area immediately south of the&nbsp; &#8220;Geographer&#8217;s Line,&#8221;&nbsp;
in southeastern Ohio. It is called&nbsp; &#8220;The Seven
Ranges&#8221;&nbsp; because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
plans called for the inclusion of seven ranges of townships in the
first tract of land to be offered for sale. In the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
survey of the seven ranges, sections are numbered from south to north
in each range, with number 1 in the southeast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
corner of the township and number 36 in the northwest corner. See

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SEWARD MERIDIAN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The principal
meridian governing surveys in southwestern Alaska; it was adopted in
1911.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SHAFT&nbsp; &#8211; In mining, an opening made at the surface and
extending downward into the earth vertically. See DRIFT,<br>

TUNNEL and ADIT.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SHORE&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The land which is covered and uncovered by
the rise and fall of the normal tide. It is the strip of land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
between the mean high water and mean low water lines. In its strictest
use, the term applies only to land along tidal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
waters. See TIDELANDS.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SHORELINE, OCEAN (T.R. No. 4)&nbsp; &#8211; The intersection of a
specified plane of water with the shore or beach (e.g., the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
high water shore line would be the intersection of the plane of mean
high water with the shore or beach). The line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
delineating the shore line on U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey nautical
charts and surveys approximates the mean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
high water line. The terms&nbsp; &#8220;shoreline&#8221;&nbsp;
and&nbsp; &#8220;coast line&#8221;&nbsp; are frequently used as being
synonymous. When&nbsp; &#8220;shore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
line&#8221;&nbsp; is used the user should specify what is meant, e.g.,
mean high water shore line, mean low water shore line, etc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
See BEACH, SHORE, COAST LINE, MEAN HIGH WATER, FORESHORE, BACKSHORE,
etc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SHORE LINE, RIVER&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The shore line is the line
which is washed by the water wherever it covers the bed of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
river within its banks. It lies along the bank at the mean level
attained by the waters of the river when they reach and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
wash the bank without overflowing it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SHORE, OCEAN&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;&nbsp; &#8220;This is the most
important of the four zones, and extends from the low water mark
inshore to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
base of the cliff (large or small), which usually marks the landward
limit of effective wave action. It is the zone over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
which the line of contact between land and sea migrates,&#8221;&nbsp; per
Shalowitz. This definition of&nbsp; &#8220;shore&#8221;&nbsp; describes the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
same zone as that given by Johnson, and Technical Report No. 4,
for&nbsp; &#8220;Beach.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The legal definition of&nbsp; &#8220;shore&#8221;&nbsp; as defined by the
U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Borax Consolidated, Ltd. V.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
City of Los Angeles, 296 U.S. 10, 22-23 (1935) is: (quote) By the civil
law, the shore extends as far as the highest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
waves reach in winter. But by common law the shore&nbsp; &#8220;is
confined to the flux and reflux of the sea at ordinary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
tides.&#8221;&nbsp; It is the land&nbsp; &#8220;between ordinary high and
low water mark, the land over which the daily tides ebb and flow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(end quote)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By those definitions the civil law (at least in California) describes
the &#8220;shore&#8221;&nbsp; or&nbsp; &#8220;beach&#8221;&nbsp; as defined by
Shalowitz,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
whereas the common law describes the same zone which is also legally
defined as the&nbsp; &#8220;tidelands.&#8221;&nbsp; See BEACH,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SHORE SPACE
LIMITATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The
limitation of 160 rods or 80 rods of shore space along navigable waters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
pertaining to certain land entries in Alaska. For provisions of

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SHORE-SPACE RESERVE,
ALASKA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A
reservation of public lands along navigable and certain other waters in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Alaska, chiefly for harborage purposes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SIC&nbsp; &#8211; Thus. Intentionally so written. Used after a word or
passage to indicate that it is meant to be exactly as printed or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to indicate that it reproduces an original even if in error as to
spelling or usage.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SIDE LINE&nbsp; &#8211; Applied to a strip of land such as a lot or other
tract, it defines the boundaries of that tract. Not applied to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the ends of a strip. In mining law, the&nbsp; &#8220;side
lines&#8221;&nbsp; of a claim, as platted or laid down on the ground, are
those which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
mark its longer dimension where it follows the course of the vein. If
the claim as a whole crosses the vein instead of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
following its course, the&nbsp; &#8220;side lines&#8221;&nbsp; are still
the boundaries of the longer dimension, even though they cross the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
vein. See END LINE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

surveys, Station Tree. See LINE TREE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SINGLE PROPORTIONATE MEASUREMENT (also called &#8220;two-way&#8221;
proportion)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A
method of proportioning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
measurement in the restoration of a lost corner whose position is
determined with reference to alinement in one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
direction. Examples of such corners are &#8211; quarter-section corners on
the line between two section corners, all corners<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
on standard parallels, and all intermediate positions on any township
boundary line. The ordinary field problem<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
consists of distributing the excess or deficiency between two existent
corners in such a way that the amount given to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
each interval shall bear the same proportion to the whole difference as
the record length of the interval bears to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
whole distance. After having applied the proportionate difference to
the record length of each interval, the sum of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the several parts will equal the new measurement of the whole distance.
See PROPORTIONATE MEASUREMENT<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and DOUBLE PROPORTIONATE MEASUREMENT.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SITE&nbsp; &#8211; A parcel of ground set apart for a specific use. The
word itself does not necessarily imply definite boundaries.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SIXTEENTH-SECTION
CORNER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
Also termed&nbsp; &#8220;quarter-quarter section corner.&#8221;&nbsp; A
corner at an extremity of a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
boundary of a quarter-quarter section; midpoint between or 20 chains
from the controlling corners on the section or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
township boundaries. Written as 1/16 section corner.<br>

SIXTH PRINCIPAL MERIDIAN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The
last of the principal meridians to be named an ordinal number, it
governs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
surveys in Kansas, Nebraska, most of Colorado and Wyoming and a small
part of South Dakota. Adopted in 1855, it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is abbreviated 6th Prin. Mer. See ORDINAL NUMBER.<br>

SKEW MERCATOR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; See
OBLIQUE MERCATOR.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SLOPE CHAINED&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; In some of the older
surveys the chaining (measuring) was done on the slope but the distances<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
measured were not always reduced to the horizontal equivalent and the
slope distance was entered in the field note<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
record. When this systematic error is detected during a retracement
cadastral surveyors refer to the line as having<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
been&nbsp; &#8220;sloped chained.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SLOPE CHAINING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The process of direct
measurement of an inclined distance and vertical angle for reduction to

SMALL TRACT ACT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The Act of
June 1, 1938 (52 Stat. 609; 43 U.S.C. 682 a-c), as amended, authorizes
the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Secretary of the Interior, under its terms and requirements, to lease
or sell parcels (not to exceed 5 acres) of vacant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
unreserved public lands, including such lands in Alaska, and public
lands withdrawn under the&nbsp; &#8220;General Orders of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Withdrawal,&#8221;&nbsp; and those lands withdrawn or reserved for any
purposes by the Secretary, but which may be classified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
by him as being chiefly valuable for sale or lease as a home,
recreation, business, or community site under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
conditions as set forth in the Act. See WITHDRAWAL and WITHDRAWAL,
GENERAL ORDERS OF.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SMALL-TRACT
CLASSIFICATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; Classification of public lands as being chiefly valuable for sale or
lease as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
small tracts; also, the public lands so classified.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SNOW BLAZE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; In regions subject to heavy
snowfall it is desirable survey practices to make a small additional
blaze<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
at a height of 6 or 8 feet above the ground on tree monuments and
bearing trees to attract attention to them during<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the winter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SOLAR ATTACHMENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; An
auxiliary device mounted on a surveyor&#8217;s instrument which mechanically
solves the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
pole-zenith-sun spherical triangle. When the sun&#8217;s declination, the
latitude of the station and hour angle of the sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
are correctly set off on the solar attachment, the instrument on which
it is mounted may readily be oriented to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
astronomic meridian.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first solar attachment was patented by William Burt and when
mounted on a surveyor&#8217;s compass it became a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Burt Solar Compass.&#8221;&nbsp; Modern solar attachments are of the
telescopic type.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SOLAR LINE&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A line run along an astronomic bearing
with a solar attachment. See TACK LINE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SOLDIERS&#8217; ADDITIONAL HOMESTEAD
ENTRY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; A selection based on rights of Civil War veterans who had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
made a homestead entry for less than 160 acres to select enough public
lands to make up the difference between the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
area of their homestead and 160 acres.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SPECIAL DEPOSIT SURVEY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A
survey authorized by law, executed by BLM personnel but at no cost to
the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
government, estimated costs to be deposited to BLM prior to survey. (43
U.S.C. 682b, 757-761, 887; 30 U.S.C. secs.<br>

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The
written statement containing the detailed specifications for every
cadastral survey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
assignment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The special instructions include the basic information necessary for
accomplishing the field work and are an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
important part of the record relating to the survey. Special
instructions are usually prepared by the officer in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
administrative charge of the work. They are usually written in the
third person and, together with the Manual and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
supportive data, contain the necessary specifications and information
for execution of the survey. See<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SPECIAL LAND USE PERMIT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A
permit which authorizes the use of public lands for purposes not

corner established at: 1) The intersection of a surveyed
subdivision-of-section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
line and a meander line; 2) The intersection of a computed center line
of a section and a meander line. In the latter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
case the center line of the section is calculated and surveyed on a
theoretical bearing to an intersection with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
meander line of a lake (over 50 acres in area) which is located
entirely within a section.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SPECIAL SURVEY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A cadastral survey that
involves unusual application of, or departure from, the rectangular<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
system. They often carry out the provisions of a special legislative
act and include such work as small tract surveys;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
townsite survey; island and omitted land surveys; homestead, homesite,
trade and manufacturing site surveys; also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

SPHERICAL
COORDINATES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Pairs of angular values such as latitude and longitude or right
ascension and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

steel pocket tape marked in chains or feet. In earlier surveyor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
usage,&nbsp; &#8220;standard&#8221;&nbsp; referred to a standard length
against which the old-style survey chain was checked for accuracy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
STANDARD CORNER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A
senior corner on a standard parallel or base line.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FORMULAS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; A supplement to the Manual of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Surveying Instructions first published by the General land office in
1910. The eighth edition was published in 1956.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The tables and data are designed for use by cadastral surveyors in the
field and office.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
STANDARD PARALLEL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
Also called&nbsp; &#8220;correction line.&#8221;&nbsp; A line extended east
or west from the principal meridian,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
usually at intervals of 24 miles north and south of the base line,
along a parallel of latitude. Standard parallels are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
established to correct for the convergence of range lines and to
maintain a workable adherence to the requirement<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that each township be 6 miles square. They are surveyed in the manner
prescribed for the survey of the base line.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
STANDARD PARALLEL,
AUXILIARY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; Where standard parallels have been placed at intervals exceeding 24
miles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(under practice permissible prior to the issuance of the 1881 Manual of
Surveying Instructions which specified 24<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
mile tracts), and conditions require additional standard lines, an
intermediate correction line is established to which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
may be given a local name, such as&nbsp; &#8220;Fifth Auxiliary Standard
parallel North,&#8221;&nbsp; or&nbsp; &#8220;Cedar Creek Correction Line.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An auxiliary standard parallel is run, in all respects, like a regular
standard parallel.<br>

STAPLE CROP&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A chief commodity or production of a
place. A crop used, needed or enjoyed by many people and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
therefore produced regularly, or in large quantities, is a&nbsp;
&#8220;staple crop.&#8221;&nbsp; Under the meaning of the grants of swamp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and overflowed lands to various states, a&nbsp; &#8220;staple
crop&#8221;&nbsp; may include tame grass or hay as well as the cereals,
cotton<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
or tobacco normally grown in a specific region. See SWAMP AND
OVERFLOWED LANDS.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
STARE DECISIS&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; To abide by, or adhere to, decided
cases. It is under the policy of&nbsp; &#8220;stare decisis&#8221;&nbsp;
that courts stand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
by precedent and do not disturb a settled point. It is the doctrine
which states that when the court has once laid down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a principle of law as applicable to certain state of facts, it will
adhere to that principle and apply it to all future cases<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
where facts are substantially the same. Also See RES JUDICATA and
OBITER DICTUM.<br>

states, used for defining positions in terms of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
plane-rectangular (x and y) coordinates. Also called State Plane
Coordinate Systems.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
STATE DIRECTOR (BLM)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The
principal Bureau official at the State level. He is directly
accountable to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Director of the Bureau of land management. Formerly called State
Supervisor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

EXCHANGE and TAYLOR ACT EXCHANGE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
STATE GRANTS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Grants of public lands
were made to States for schools and other public purposes. The most<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
common State grants are: school, swamp, tide land, land under navigable
waters, and lands for internal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
improvements. Generally, title to State grant lands could pass only
after survey of the lands. Originally, mineral<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
lands were excluded. Also excluded were lands taken by settlers,
withdrawn for public purposes or otherwise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
disposed of by the Government. These grants by Congress were grants
which may pass title to lands without further<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
approval or documentation by a Federal agency. See SCHOOL LAND PATENT,
INDEMNITY LANDS and<br>

SURVEYING
INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
Various regions of the United States have been surveyed under amended or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
differing instructions from the passage of the first Land Ordinance to
the present. The Ordinance of May 20, 1785,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
gave explicit cadastral survey instructions which were to be carried
out under the personal supervision of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Geographer of the United States, Thomas Hutchins. His successor, Rufus
Putnam, was given the title&nbsp; &#8220;Surveyor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
General of the Northwest Territory&#8221;&nbsp; under the terms of the
Act of May 18,. 1796. He wrote letters of instruction to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
deputy surveyors as did his successors, Jared Mansfield and Josiah
Meigs. In 1815, Edward Tiffin, who succeeded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meigs as Surveyor General of Territories east of the Mississippi,
issued the first signed and dated general<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
instructions for the guidance of deputy surveyors, though they were
partially based on an unsigned, undated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
manuscript prepared earlier by Mansfield. Other printed circulars
followed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1851, a Manual of Instructions was issued to the Surveyor General of
Oregon. After that came the Manual of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1855, the Manual of 1871 (a copy of the 1855 manual), the Manual of
1881, the Manual of 1890, the Manual of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1894 and the Manual of 1902. In 1919, a part of the Manual of 1930 was
published, then the Manual of 1930 and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Manual of 1947. The Manual of Surveying Instructions for the Survey of
the Public Lands of the United States,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1973, is the current manual of surveying instructions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SURVEYING, LAND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The determination of
boundaries and areas of tracts of land. Land boundaries are usually<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
defined by ownership, commencing with the earliest owners through
successive ownerships and partitions. Land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
surveying includes the re-establishment of original boundaries and the
establishment of such new boundaries as may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
be required in the partition of the land. See CADASTRAL SURVEY.<br>

The Act of May 18,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1796, abolished the office of the Geographer of the United States and
provided for the appointment of a Surveyor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
General. President George Washington appointed Rufus Putnam Surveyor
General of the Northwest Territory under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the terms of this act. See ACT OF MAY 18, 1796, GEOGRAPHER OF THE

HEREDITAMENT.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TERRITORY (methods of acquisition)&nbsp; &#8211; The United States has
acquired territory principally by the following three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
methods:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.&nbsp; by treaty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.&nbsp; by joint resolution of the two houses of Congress<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3.&nbsp; by statute.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TERRITORY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; In American law, a portion of
the United States, not within the limits of any state, which has not yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
been admitted as a state of the Union, but is organized with a separate
legislature, and with executive and judicial<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
officers appointed by the president.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TERRITORY NORTHWEST OF THE OHIO
RIVER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; The Territory bounded on the west by the Mississippi River<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and a line running north from its source to the international boundary,
on the north by the boundary line between the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
United States and the British possessions, on the east by the
Pennsylvania and New York State lines, and on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
south by the Ohio River. It was made up of claims of Virginia,
Connecticut and Massachusetts, and comprised an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
area of approximately 278,000 square miles. From this territory the
states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wisconsin were formed. It also included that part of Minnesota which
lies east of the Mississippi River and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
northwest corner of Pennsylvania.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

witness, under oath or affirmation; as distinguished from evidence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
derived from writings and other sources. The words&nbsp;
&#8220;testimony&#8221;&nbsp; and&nbsp; &#8220;evidence&#8221;&nbsp; are not
synonymous. See<br>

EVIDENCE and WITNESS, EXPERT.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TEXAS ACCESSION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The Republic of Texas
was admitted as a State in 1845, but retained title to all unoccupied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
lands. Thus, Texas was not a public-land State. Part of this territory
was, however, purchased by the United States in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1850, and is now included in the States of Kansas, Colorado, New
Mexico, Oklahoma and Wyoming. This purchase<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
added approximately 75 million acres of public lands to the United
States.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
THALWEG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; The&nbsp;
&#8220;downway,&#8221;&nbsp; meaning the course taken by boats going downstream
in a river. The line following<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the lowest part of a valley, whether under water or not. The intricacy
of detail in ordinary relief often makes difficult<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a practical location of a thalweg; in a survey of a political boundary
line this difficulty may assume considerable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
weight. A thalweg may also be defined as the line down the center of
the main channel of a stream or as the line of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
greatest slope, cutting all contours at right angles. See THREAD OF THE
STREAM and RULE OF THALWEG.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
THENCE&nbsp; &#8211; In surveying and in metes and bounds descriptions,
the term designates that the course and distance given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
thereafter is a continuation from the course and distance given before.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
THENCE DOWN THE
RIVER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
This phase, as used in a surveyor&#8217;s field notes, is construed to
mean&nbsp; &#8220;with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
meanders of the river.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
THEODOLITE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A precision surveying
instrument for measuring horizontal and vertical angles. The graduated
circles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
are usually read by means of optical microscopes and are more precisely
graduated than are the circles on a transit.<br>

THIRD PRINCIPAL
MERIDIAN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The
principal meridian, adopted in 1805, which governs surveys in a large
part<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of Illinois. It is abbreviated 3rd Prin. Mer.<br>

Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,
South Carolina and Georgia.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
THREAD OF THE STREAM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; Though the courts do not always agree on definitions, the great
weight of authority is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to the effect that the thread of the stream is the center of the main
channel thereof. If there are two prominent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
channels, the thread of the stream is the center of the channel used
for navigation. See THALWEG and MEDIUM<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
FILUM ACQUAE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
THROW&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; In mining, the vertical distance between
the parts of a vein which have been separated by a fault, measured<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
at right angles to the strike of the fault. A horizontal fault can have
no&nbsp; throw , and a vertical fault can have no&nbsp; heave .<br>

See HEAVE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TIDAL CURRENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A horizontal movement of
the water caused by gravitational interactions between the sun, moon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and earth. See TIDE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TIDAL DATUM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A reference for leveling
defined by tidal phase observation and measurements. Mean sea level is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
usually used as the datum for elevations. Mean high water, mean low
water and similar terms are tidal datums.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TIDE&nbsp; &#8211; The periodic rising and falling of the water that
results from the gravitational attraction of the moon and sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
acting upon the rotating earth. See TIDAL CURRENT.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TIDE, EBB&nbsp; &#8211; The movement of the tidal current away from the
shore or down a tidal stream. The correct technical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
term is&nbsp; &#8220;Ebb Current.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TIDE, FLOOD&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The movement of a tidal current
toward the shore or up a tidal stream. The correct technical term is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Flood Current.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TIDELANDS&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Coastal areas situated above mean low
tide and below mean high tide, particularly the areas alternately<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
covered and uncovered by the daily tides. As part of the bed of
navigable waters, such lands belong to the states by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
right of sovereignty. Tidelands, including coastal&nbsp; &#8220;salt
marshes&#8221;&nbsp; are not subject to survey. In contrast, coastal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
marshes not covered by daily tides are&nbsp; &#8220;swamp and overflowed
lands&#8221;&nbsp; within the meaning of the various&nbsp; &#8220;Swamp<br>

TIMBER AND STONE ACT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; An 1878
act which authorized the negotiated sale of public lands especially
valuable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

TIMBER CULTURE ACT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
In 1873 Congress passed an act to encourage the growth of timber on the
western<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
prairies. It provided for the entry of public lands if the entryman
planted and cultivated trees on a specified part of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the land. The law was repealed in 1891.<br>

TOWNSHIP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The unit of survey of the
public lands; normally a quadrangle approximately 6 miles on a side with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
boundaries conforming to meridians and parallels within established
limits, containing thirty-six sections, some of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TRACT&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Generally, a metes and bounds survey of an
area at large within a township. In modern public land surveys<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the term is used specifically to mean a parcel of land that lies in
more than one section or that cannot be identified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
completely as a part of a particular section. Tract numbers begin with
the next higher number of the numerical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
designation within a township, for example: if there is an old numbers
are sequential and no number is repeated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
within a township, for example; if there is an old Mineral Lot No. 37,
the tract would be Tract No. 38. If a tract falls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
across a township line it is given a separate number in each township.
See LOT.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TRACT BOOK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; Starting about 1800, tract
books designed primarily for the maintenance of permanent records of all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
transactions involving public domain lands were created and maintained
in local land offices. Tract books were the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
companion records to the land office&nbsp; &#8220;status plat.&#8221;&nbsp;
Prior to the beginning of the records improvement program in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1955, these records constituted the records required in accordance with
43 C.F.R. 1813.1-1. Over the years, many of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the tract books became worn and mutilated making status difficult to
determine. To protect these books from further<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
damage and to preserve the information they contain, these records are
now microfilmed. As this is done, the tract<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
books are transferred to the appropriate Federal records center as part
of the National Archives. See LAND OFFICE<br>

TREATY OF GHENT, 1814&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; By the treaty of
peace concluded at Ghent (Belgium) on December 24, 1814, it was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
agreed to provide for a final adjustment of the boundaries described in
the Treaty of 1783 that had not yet been<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ascertained and determined, embracing certain islands in the Bay of
Fundy and the whole of the boundary line from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the source of the River St. Croix to the most northwestern point of the
Lake of the Woods.<br>

TREATY OF GUADALUPE
HILDAGO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8211; The peace treaty signed Feb. 2, 1848, at the close of the Mexican War,<br>

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN,
1782&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The original
limits of the United States were first definitely described in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the provisional treaty concluded with Great Britain on November 30,
1782.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN,
1783&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The definite
treaty of peace with Great Britain concluded on September<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3, 1783, defines the boundaries of the United States in terms similar
to those of the provisional treaty. The northern<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
boundary became at once a fruitful source of dissension between the two
countries. From the time of the conclusion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of peace almost to the present day (1954) the definite location of this
line has been subject to a series of treaties,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
commissions, and surveys.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TREATY WITH SPAIN, 1795&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The southern
boundary of the United States was described in definite terms by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
treaties with Great Britain of 1782 and 1783, but its location was not
accepted by Spain and was disputed by that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
country until settled by the treaty concluded on October 27, 1795.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TREATY WITH SPAIN, 1819&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The treaty of
February 22, 1819, settled conflicting claims between the United States<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and Spain concerning East and West Florida. The third article of the
treaty defines the boundary between the United<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
States and the Spanish possessions in the Southwest. The western
boundary of the United States south of the 42nd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
parallel, as fixed by this treaty, was confirmed by treaty with Mexico
on January 12, 1828, since by that time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mexico had gained independence from Spain.<br>

exceed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3000 feet as imposed by Federal law. When a lode is discovered within a
tunnel, the owner is called upon to make a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
surface location of the vein or lode as required by law. Discontinuing
operations for 6 months constitutes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
abandonment of all right to the veins along the line of the tunnel.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TWENTY-FOUR-MILE
TRACTS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;
The largest unit in the rectangular system of surveys. Each area
controlled by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
principal meridian and a base line is divided into tracts by means of
standard parallels or correction lines (true<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
parallels of latitude) located at intervals of 24 miles to the north
and south of the base line and by means of guide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
meridians (true meridians) spaced at intervals of 24 miles east and
west of the principal meridian. Because of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
convergence of the meridians, the distance between the guide meridians
is 24 miles only at the starting points; at all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
other points, the distance is less by the amount of the convergence.
Twenty-four-mile tracts were first specified in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the 1881 Manual of Surveying Instructions.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
UMIAT MERIDIAN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; The principal meridian
governing surveys in the northern part of Alaska. It was adopted in<br>

1956.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
UNITED STATES CODE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; A
compilation, under 50 subjects, or titles, of the general and permanent
laws of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
United States in force as of an indicated date. Most of the statutes
governing the operations of the Bureau of Land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Management appear in Title 43,&nbsp; &#8220;Public Lands,&#8221;&nbsp; and
title 30,&nbsp; &#8220;Mineral Lands and Mining.&#8221;&nbsp; Many laws
relating to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Alaska are found in Title 48,&nbsp; &#8220;Territories and Insular

Sometimes U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals. The middle level of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
federal judicial hierarchy. There is one such court in each of the 11
judicial circuits into which the United States is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
divided. As the name indicates, the jurisdiction is exclusively
appellate; they have no original jurisdiction. In cases<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
where a court of appeals has held a State statute invalid because of
repugnancy to the Constitution or a law or treaty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the United States, an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court. In
all other cases its decisions are final except as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
they may be reviewed by the Supreme Court at the latter&#8217;s discretion.

the adoption of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
meridian of the observatory at Washington, which passes through the old
Naval Observatory at 24th Street and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., as the American Meridian
for all astronomic purposes. The meridian<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of Greenwich was, under this act, adopted for all nautical purposes.
The act was repealed August 22, 1912 (37 Stat.<br>

ZONE &#8211; The unit of division in State Plane Coordinate
Systems created where state boundaries extend beyond limits imposed in
the design of the projection system. Where the scale error between a
geodetic distance and its grid representation exceeds 1 in 10,000 a
state was usually divided into two or more zones. A new origin is used
for each zone. See DANGER ZONE.
<p><strong style="color: black;">Zero</strong> - Zero degrees, minutes, and
seconds. A perfect zero<br>
<strong style="color: lime;">Zenith</strong> is the direction pointing
directly above a particular location (perpendicular, orthogonal). Since the
concept of being above is itself somewhat vague, scientists define the
zenith in more rigorous terms. Specifically, in astronomy, geophysics and
related sciences (e.g., meteorology), the zenith at a given point is the
local vertical direction pointing away from direction of the force of
gravity at that location.<br>
The <strong>zenith</strong> is used in the following scientific
contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>It serves as the direction of reference for measuring the
<strong>zenith angle</strong>, which is the angular distance between a
direction of interest (e.g., a star) and the local zenith, relative to
the point for which the zenith is defined.</li>
<li>It defines one of the axes of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system" title="Horizontal coordinate system">horizontal coordinate system</a> in
astronomy.</li>
</ul>

<strong style="color: black;">Zoning</strong>-a term used in urban planning
for a system of land-use regulation in various parts of the world,
including North America, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The word is
derived from the practice of designating permitted uses of land based on
mapped zones which separate one set of land uses from another. Zoning may
be use-based (regulating the uses to which land may be put), or it may
regulate building height, lot coverage, and similar characteristics, or
some combination of these. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning">link Wikipedia</a>]<br>
